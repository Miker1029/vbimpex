ImpEx, vBulletin Import System 
=============

User Documentation
-------
The Impex manual is still housed on vBulletin.com. We suggest reading it before getting started.

Installation
-------
The basics of the installations are as follows:
<ol>
<li>Download the package from github and extract the files from the zip.</li>
<li>Rename the vbimpex folder to impex.</li>
<li>Rename the ImpExConfig.php.new file to ImpExConfig.php</li>
<li>Edit the ImpExConfig.php file, you'll need to enter the database information for the database you wish to import to, and import from.</li>
<li>Upload the ImpEx files to your server in the same folder as your vBulletin file(s).</li>
</ol>

ImpEx passcode
-------
Since we no longer distrubute ImpEx though our build servers, we've added a passcode feature. This allows you to secure your installation. By default it is set to test. We highly recommend you set a good and secure password.
This will be the password you use to get into the impex system.
